	<h2> About me </h2>
<p> As a kid in Puerto Rico, my mom and I would spend four hours in a Borders bookstore waiting for my brother to finish his Boys Scouts meetings. There, I fell in love with books which led to a domino effect on my love for the arts. From ages 8 to 10, I would write and illustrate my own stories and in high school, I was known as the girl who would have a book in her hand during free periods. </p>
<br>
</br>
<p>As a Journalism major, I'm really happy I get to write all the time, and after a few film classes I developed a passion for film so I decided to double major! One of my favorite things so far I've done in my film classes is edit videos, I even do that in my spare time for my own pleasure. I'm always putting together one minute montages about my favorite films, or certain concepts within famous films (i.e. love in films).</p>
<p>My skills include:
	<p> <ol>
			<li> Basic Web Design (something like this site!) </li>
			<li> Proficiency in Adobe Creative Suite (my favorite is Premiere Pro)</li>
			<li> Developing digital and print content </li>
			<li> Extreme attention to detail </li>
			<li> Multitasking and working under tight deadlines </li>
		</ol> </p>
<p>
	Writing is my favorite form of self expression, take a glimpse at some of my work <a href= works.html> here.</a>
	<p> Fun facts about me: </p>
		<ol>
			<li> My favorite directors are Greta Gerwig, Lulu Wang, Wes Anderson, and Ari Aster. </li>
			<li> I'm a Pisces sun, Taurus moon, and Gemini rising. </li>
			<li> I love traveling; my favorite places so far have been: Cancun, Barcelona, Toledo, and Disney World (happiest place on Earth, right?).</li>
