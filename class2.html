Determined. Organized. Impulsive. Passionate. Beautiful. Woke.
<br>
</br>
Those are just a few words Aliana Bigio’s friends use to describe the Puerto Rican feminist with a desire to change the world, in her case, by educating all of her 13.7K followers on Instagram.
  <br>
</br>
Bigio is a 21-year-old senior at the University of Puerto Rico, majoring in Political Science with a minor in Gender Studies. She is also the proud founder of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/con.sentimientopr/" target="https://www.instagram.com/con.sentimientopr/"> CON(Sentimiento) </a>, an Instagram and Facebook blog where she discusses topics like white feminism, abortion, how problematic some Disney movies are, politics, racism, privilege, etc. “In college, I realized I wanted to take these conversations elsewhere. I didn’t want them to stay in the classroom,” she says. “So, I created a community on social media about learning and unlearning.”
<br>
</br>
“I don’t care about follower count in the way some people do,” she says. “If anything, my follower count means there’s that many people out there who care about the issues I’m talking about which makes me very hopeful.”
<br>
</br>
Her blog’s name is a play on the Spanish words “consentimiento” means consent, while “con sentimiento” means ‘with feeling.’ When Bigio launched her account in October 2018, she had no idea it would be so well received as it did.
<br>
</br>
She laughed when I said she was becoming an ‘Influencer for wokeness’: “I guess you can call it that, but unlike real influencers, I don’t get paid for posting.”
<br>
</br>
Followers won’t catch her recording everything she does or acting like she’s above anyone else. Bigio recognizes how powerful her platform is but it doesn’t get to her head. “I’m just a regular girl who loves drawing, painting, and taking my dog on walks!” She says. Bigio also enjoys going back to her old high school, Notre Dame High School (which is this reporter’s alma mater as well), in Caguas, Puerto Rico, to mentor and help students in a popular theater club that goes on competitions.
<br>
</br>
Aliana Bigio recently mentored college freshman Cecilia Otero during her senior year. “When she mentored me, the first thing I noticed was how much of a natural she is,” says Otero. “Aliana took my script and made it a thousand times better. She may not have pursued acting or writing, but she’s extremely talented at both those things.”
<br>
</br>
Over the summer, Puerto Rico erupted in protests against their former Governor Ricardo Rosselló after screenshots were leaked about a groupchat several high-ranking government officials took part in, where they made homophobic and sexist remarks and even joked about the death toll from Hurricane Maria. Bigio was one of the leading people in those protests. She would sit outside the Governor’s mansion every day (until his resignation) with other women and they would cover their mouths with tape with messages on it.

“Those days were surreal. I saw my island united with the same purpose, it was very impactful.” Bigio remained humble and did not mention that her Instagram post calling Puerto Rico to a massive protest was shared by Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny, which caused her to go from 7,000 to 12,500 followers in just a few days. During that time, she was interviewed by VICE News alongside other women leaders and her own baby sister, for a segment about the protests that was aired on HBO.
<br>
</br>
Aliana Bigio doesn’t have her entire future planned out, but she knows which direction she’s headed toward. “I see myself staying in Puerto Rico and studying law,” she says. “I hope CON(Sentimiento) continues to grow so I can expand my platform and create workshops and participate in talks/events.”
<br>
</br>
As for Puerto Rico’s future… “I don’t know in what way, but we’re going to make history. Again.”
