    <h5> <a href="clara_index.html"> Back to Home Page </a></h5>
    <p> Born in March, in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, I am convinced reading and writing was embedded in my DNA. Ever since I was a little kid, I've been connected to letters and art. I would write and illustrate my own short stories at age 9. Ten years later, I'm writing about fashion, arts and culture, film, and issues surrounding Puerto Rico. I am a sophomore at The New School, studying Journalism and Culture and Media, hoping one day Teen Vogue or Vulture hire me. In high school, I broke the record for the most views on an <a href="https://miamihighnews.com/2018/01/17/puerto-rico-se-levanta-2/"target=https://miamihighnews.com/2018/01/17/puerto-rico-se-levanta-2/> article </a> in their news website, which prompted my teacher and classmates to give me a round of applause as I sank into my seat. </p>
    <p> Before the 2018 distasteful Academy Awards, I published an article for Miuse Magazine that was deleted after some rebranding but you can find it in my <a href="writing.html"> Writing </a> page.</p>
