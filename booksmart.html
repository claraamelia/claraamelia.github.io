The Booksmart tale is set on the last day of high school in the suburbs of Los Angeles and at its center is a pair of ambitious and studious best friends, Molly and Amy. Molly, played by Beanie Feldstein (a scene stealer in ​Lady Bird​), thinks she’s better than everyone else, with the exception of BFF Amy. Her alarm’s ringtone is set to the Hail to the Chief Presidential anthem – she’s the Student Body President – and soon she’ll be in Yale and eventually become, according to her, the youngest Justice ever nominated to the Supreme Court. Amy, played by Kaitlyn Dever (fantastic in her dramatic roles in ​Short Term 12 ​and​ Unbelievable)​ , is labeled as Molly’s quieter sidekick but is just as brilliant in her own right and will spend the summer making tampons for women in Botswana before attending Columbia. While their classmates have been hanging out and messing around, the duo spent their time in college libraries and strengthening their résumés.

<p> Molly’s assumptions of the world are shattered in a school bathroom when she learns the classmates she’s perceived as slackers who only care about sex and partying are also attending Ivy Leagues and other highly ranked schools. Only one of her peers isn’t going to college... because he got recruited to code for Google.

“We chose, we didn’t party because we wanted to focus on school and get into good colleges. But the irresponsible people who partied also got into those colleges, they did both,” Molly says to Amy, a few minutes before chucking a celebratory cake off a hill. After the shocking revelation, Molly is determined to cram four years of partying in one night. </p>

      Keeping the basic plot in mind, the ​Superbad​ comparisons are appropriate (Feldstein is also Jonah Hill’s little sister). But Olivia Wilde’s directorial debut — released in May 2019 and currently on Hulu — is less sex obsessed and more focused on female friendships and high school stereotypes (the nerds, jocks, stoners, etc.) as myths to be debunked. ​Booksmart​ is not completely deprived of sex, both Molly and Amy pursue their own romantic endeavors, talk
 
candidly about masturbation, and respectfully learn about lesbian sex via porn: “It’s just a sexy documentary! It’s a hot doc.”</p>
