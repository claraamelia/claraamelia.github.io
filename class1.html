In the same universe, and neighboring borough, as the CW’s Riverdale, there is Greendale: the eerie small town where, to quote the main character Sabrina Spellman (played by Kiernan Shipka), “always feels like Halloween.” Netflix’s The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina follows the story of the beloved title character millennials grew up watching in ABC Family’s Sabrina the Teenage Witch. The show delivers funny moments, portrays how feminism works in a really small town, and deceives audiences as to what Satanism really is.
<br>
</br>
Back in the late 90’s, Sabrina Spellman’s (Melissa Joan Hart) problems were comical, like the time she couldn’t find her homework. In the sinister 2018 reboot, she has to sign her name in the Book of the Beast, a book where witches and warlocks sign their name as a pledge of allegiance to Satan, in a 16th birthday during a ceremony called ‘the Dark Baptism.’
<br>
</br>
After the Book of the Beast ceremony, no witch can maintain their relationships with mortals and will have to attend a school specifically for witches, where Sabrina’s father was a progressive Headmaster, but is now led by a more traditional and conservative leader (remind you of anything?) The required transfer is a problem for Sabrina because she loves her mortal boyfriend and friends and she’s suspicious of signing away her name to Satan. However, like Father Blackwood (Richard Coyle), the High Priest of their coven  called the Church of Night, said in the second episode, “All religions demand some sacrifice.” The sacrifice here is nothing less than her very freedom. The episode ends with everyone’s second favorite witch , refusing to sign her name and delivering the iconic line, “My name is Sabrina Spellman and I will not sign it away!” This is one of the many examples of Sabrina being a feminist and challenging the institution that is her coven.
<br>
</br>
The character Sabrina Spellman first appeared in the Archie comics in 1962 but it wasn’t until the early 70s that she got her own animated show along with a developed origin story.
<br>
</br>
According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/television/chilling-adentures-sabrina-teenage-witch-history.html" target="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/television/chilling-adentures-sabrina-teenage-witch-history.html">the New York Times</a>, the series ran until 1974 and then made a brief appearance in an Archie show that was quickly canceled after one season. The world didn’t get to see the witch until the mid-90s when “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” became the highest-rated series in ABC’s T.G.I.F. lineup and had more than 17 million viewers.

After the hit show was cancelled in 2003, Sabrina Spellman did not resurface until Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Riverdale and Sabrina’s creator, wrote a supernatural version of the Archie comics where he included the famous witch. In 2014, Aguirre-Sacasa began writing Sabrina’s own comic book and after developing Riverdale for the CW, he focused on creating the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina for Netflix.
<br>
</br>
The dark coming-of-age series that has been renewed for another season, is clearly very different from the original sitcom. One of the differences that caught audiences’ attention was Salem’s (Sabrina’s cat) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/television/chilling-adentures-sabrina-teenage-witch-history.html" target="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/television/chilling-adentures-sabrina-teenage-witch-history.html">lack of talking</a>. The clearer difference between the two versions of the show is the Spellman’s devotion to Satan. In the Teenage Witch, Sabrina and her aunts’ powers were not linked to any religion. Here, Auntie Zelda and Auntie Hilda are clearly Satanists (in the sense of being loyal to him) and say phrases like ‘Satan-given right’ and ‘unholy ceremony.’
<br>
</br>
As the rebooted show’s main characters devote their life to the Dark Lord (what they call Satan on the show), many people are not aware that Satanism is a religion with real followers today. According to <a href="https://www.learnreligions.com/laveyan-satanism-theistic-satanism-and-luciferianism-95715" target="https://www.learnreligions.com/laveyan-satanism-theistic-satanism-and-luciferianism-95715">ThoughtCo.</a>, there are twelve branches of Satanism, the two most popular being the <a href="https://www.churchofsatan.com/" target="https://www.churchofsatan.com/">Church of Satan</a>, known in mainstream media for <a href="https://www.theringer.com/pop-culture/2017/8/22/16184422/church-of-satan-twitter-interview" target="https://www.theringer.com/pop-culture/2017/8/22/16184422/church-of-satan-twitter-interview">taking over Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://thesatanictemple.com/" target="https://thesatanictemple.com/">the Satanic Temple</a>, known for filing a 50 million dollar lawsuit against Netflix and Sabrina for allegedly copying a statue of a winged half-man, half-goat representing Satan. However, neither religion associates itself with Satan himself.
<br>
</br>
Yet, in the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, it is clear from the first episode that everyone who is a witch or warlock has to worship Satan, a creature who represents and does evil. According to the Church of Satan, witches and warlocks do not exist and, “Satanists are atheists. Satan to us is a symbol of pride, liberty and individualism, and it serves as an external metaphorical projection of our highest personal potential.” While, Satanic Temple’s mission is “to encourage benevolence and empathy among all people reject tyrannical authority, advocate practical common sense and justice, and be directed by the human conscience to undertake noble pursuits guided by the individual will.” When many of us think about Satanism we probably imagine people devoting their lives to the devil and making animal sacrifices, but that’s not actually what real life Satanist organizations are about. So why (and how) is Sabrina Spellman’s coven, the Church of Night perpetuating it?

It is clear that the Satanism portrayed in the show is extreme (but deemed normal among the witches and warlocks). They call the Catholic God the ‘false God’, cast spells on witches who maintain meaningful relationships with mortals, and even the Dark Lord himself sues whoever refuses to sign their name in the Book of the Beast. For Sabrina’s viewers, which are probably mostly women since <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/netflix-statistics/#1" target="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/netflix-statistics/#1"> 57% of all Netflix subscriptions are paid by women </a>, it is more entertaining to see Satanists have a familiar (an animal companion that advises them), exhibit their magic powers and the ability to rise from the dead. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina wouldn’t have gotten picked up by Netflix if it involved the Spellman’s with no connections to the supernatural and self-therapy as rituals. Sometimes, the real world is too much to handle, and as humans, it’s totally understandable that we want an escape. In the end, all fantasy tv shows, books, and movies are stories about humanity with a lesson to be learned.
<br>
</br>
The show also appeals to a new audience and young adults by making Sabrina a feminist witch; she is co-founder of a school club called WICCA (Women’s Intersectional Creative Cultural Association) which is not only a way to overthrow the patriarchy in Greendale High School but is also a play on words as a nod to the Wiccan religion. While they do not explain what they mean by intersectional, Sabrina and her friends make it very clear the club welcomes every woman in Greendale with open arms.

  Although millennials still call the 1996 version of Sabrina a feminist icon, compared to the 2018 Sabrina, the Teenage Witch does not seem revolutionary on the surface, due to the fact that its dialogue and plot weren’t very liberal up front. However, in the reboot, feminism is loud and clear, not only when Sabrina and her friends create a safe space for women but also when Sabrina defies Satan and an entire religious institution.
<br>
</br>
“I have reservations about saving myself for the Dark Lord. Why does he get to decide what I do or don’t do with my body?” Sabrina asked Father Blackwood.
<br>
</br>
This portrayal is timely and important, since we’re living in a time where women’s voices are important, and their stories are starting to be heard louder and more clearly. It’s 2019 for Satan’s sake.

The feminism angle this show displays is not only a story that needs to be told but also a strategy to attract more viewers. The narrative of a young woman trying to forge her own path with a desire to strike down the patriarchy resonates with women. It also tells viewers that it is not only hard being a woman in the real world, due to the political climate, but also in a fictional and small, supernatural town.
<br>
</br>
In January 2018, the Satanic Temple went to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/satanic-temple-challenges-missouri-s-abortion-law-religious-grounds-n839891" target"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/satanic-temple-challenges-missouri-s-abortion-law-religious-grounds-n839891"> the Missouri Supreme Court</a> to challenge the state’s informed consent abortion law on behalf of a woman identified as Mary Doe. They claim, since her Satanist beliefs were different than the ones of the Planned Parenthood pamphlet, her religious beliefs were ignored. Unfortunately, <a href="https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/missouri-supreme-court-throws-out-challenge-states-abortion-law#stream/0" target="https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/missouri-supreme-court-throws-out-challenge-states-abortion-law#stream/0">they lost the case</a>. And Per Faxneld , a professor in History of Religions in Stockholm University, published his doctoral dissertation, Satanic Feminism: Lucifer as the Liberator of Women in Nineteenth-Century Culture, which breaks down how women in the 19th century used the Devil as a figure to reject the patriarchal traits of Christianity. Also, like I mentioned earlier, it is part of the Satanic Temple’s mission to “advocate practical common sense and justice.”
<br>
</br>
What I’ve mentioned above only leads me to one conclusion: Satanism, in general, is a vessel for feminist beliefs. Meanwhile, Sabrina (the character) is the key to making her version of Satanism feminist.
<br>
</br>
The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina could potentially mislead people, telling audiences that Satanism is selling your soul to the devil and making outlandish rituals. While in real life, Satanists just want to spread empathy and denounce authority. On the other hand, it represents non-binary folks and women’s stories.
<br>
</br>
Even if the show revolves around people with powers given to them by the devil and once you turn sixteen, you relinquish your freedom to the Dark Lord, all that can be overlooked in order to appreciate the storylines and narratives being shown and celebrated. Plenty of loyal viewers of the show (myself included) wish they lived in that small town. Thanks to Sabrina, Satanism is a way to fight the patriarchy at Greendale.
