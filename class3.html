<strong>NEW YORK CITY (April 22, 2020)</strong> — A24 Films have launched a digital platform called A24 auctions, where costumes and props for their most popular titles are being auctioned for charity. Donations will “support doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers by providing meals, prepackaged groceries, hotel rooms, laundry service, and scrubs for these heroic workers.”
<br>
</br>
A24 is an American independent entertainment company that focuses on film and television production and distribution. They have birthed some of the most popular films in Hollywood, like Lady Bird, Moonlight, Room, Midsommar, and HBO’s hit show Euphoria. The company has received 25 Academy Award nominations, having brought home Best Visual Effects, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Documentary Feature, and Best Picture. Filmmakers have described their logo at the beginning of a film as a stamp of approval.
<br>
</br>
There is one auction currently taking place and three more planned in the following weeks. Right now, A24’s Attic Auction lets you place a bid for items like the staple purple hoodie worn by Zendaya in Euphoria (currently at $6,000) for the benefit of NYC Health + Hospital and it is up for grabs until May 8th.

On April 27th, the Midsommar Hårga Collectibles auction opens where insanely popular items will be auctioned off. Such as, the bear headdress worn by the main character’s boyfriend and the opulent May Queen flower dress. On May 4th, the Gems from Gems auction will let people place their bids on a prom dress worn by Idina Menzel, a Celtics jersey worn by Kevin Garnett, and a black and yellow staple shirt worn by Adam Sandler, all from last Christmas’s hit, Uncut Gems. They’ve also included the bedazzled Furby necklace held by Sandler. The final auction that features items from The Lighthouse and opens May 11th, does not include any of the wardrobe; however, it does include fancy mermaid décor and lamps used in the movie.

Any fan of the films might have a chance to own (and maybe wear out if they want!) clothes and accessories worn by the actors that also are staple pieces in the films and show, all for the fight against COVID-19.

A24 said in an official statement: “As a company founded and based in New York City, A24 wants to give back to the city as it weathers this crisis and begins to rebuild. 100% of each auction’s proceeds will be donated to one of four charities helping New York City’s hardest-hit communities and frontline workers: FDNY Foundation; Food Bank For NYC; NYC Health + Hospitals; and Queens Community House.”

ABOUT A24:
A24 is an American independent entertainment company founded on August 20, 2012,[3] by Daniel Katz, David Fenkel, and John Hodges and based in New York City. It specializes in film distribution, and film and television production. In recent years, A24 has developed a steady fanbase of followers. While a following of specific distribution companies is typically uncommon, fans laude A24 over their choice of artistically dense and involved films and their leniency and freedom during production, giving filmmakers more creative freedom than most non-independent companies.
